            <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the 
                volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, 
                going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting 
                several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, 
                taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, 
                a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are in 
                Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</p>
        
        <h2>Sightseeing</h2>
